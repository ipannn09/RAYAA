        hiii thereeee ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹.... I know we don't talk anymore, and I know you don't want to..but I
        just want to say that SELAMAT HARI RAYA MAAF ZAHIR BATIN,I hope you had a day filled with blessings.
        peace and happiness on this eid...thank you so much Ain, for being a part of my life.. 
        and I really appreciate the moments we've shared...remember when we used to spend hours talking
        about our dreams? I can't help but think about all the beautiful memories we shared.
        Remember back then, when we first met to go to the Kelab Pengguna Event ??? on 22 July 2023?? This
        incident was the best birthday gift I had ever gotten in my entire lifee.. At very first sight, I never
        thought that you could make me fall in love with you.. but the way you treated me on that day changed
        everything. not only that, your cute voice during the whole event makes my heart want to explode... 
        Fyi I still remember the moment when you almost slipped when we crossed the river...I
        couldn't hold myself on that day so I told Adib about it.. and he's reaction was insane.. don't
        forget about Farisa that helped us though...I think if she didn't ask picture from you we wouldn't get
        this close eventho we don't even chatting.. OH OH,, there's MOREEEEE,, I still remember Monday before
        we went to Penang for the English program... When Adib, Fareez and I went to collect parent's
        approval letter.I heard your friend told you that "Ain cikgu hang mai tu".. where on that day I was
        acting as a teacher.. at frist three of us were blank and didn't know everythings. UNTILLLL Irsyad
        told me that you WERE like me on Thursday.. At first I thought he was kidding since I in the bad mood
        that day.. So I just play along wiht him.. where on the weekend I told Irsyad to help me pull you.. I
        swear I was kidding on that day because I just realize that I won't worth for you.. I didn't know
        that he WAS that DUMB to told you about that.. I'm kind scared for a moment until he forced me to chat you
        first.. For me he was a hero.. without him i don't think we can be together.. and after that all
        becoming HISTORICAL MOMENTS.. WAITTTT... There's one more importance event... remember when we go to
        Stadium Batu Kawan??? ala during Hari Sukan Negara tuuu.... at first I really really want to ask you
        for a walk on that day.. you know just to of us.. but yeah there're some "halanagan" on that day... 
        first was my friends where they didn't no yet that I'm with you and second was you're enjoy with your friends
        and I didn't want to "mengganggu". heheeee...I often find myself looking at old photographs and
        reminiscing about the good times we had together.You were a significant part of my life, and I'll
        always cherish those moments.Sometimes, I stumble upon things that remind me of you. It's
        incredible how certain scents or sounds can transport me back to the moments we shared...so I would
        take this opportunity if i have ever hurt you in any way ... please know that it was never my
        intention.. I realize that I made mistakes in our relationship. I'm truly sorry for any pain I caused
        you. If there's any chance for forgiveness, I would be grateful for the opportunity to make things
        right. It took me some time to realize the errors of my ways. I now understand the importance of
        communication and compromise in a relationship.I'm sorry for not being the partner you deserved.
        I've had time to reflect on our relationship, and I acknowledge that I wasn't always there for you when
        you needed me. I'm sorry for not providing the support and love you deserved. I owe
        you an apology for not appreciating your worth when we were together.I now understand how
        valuable you were to my life.I want you to know that I'm grateful for the lessons you taught me
        about love, resilience, and forgiveness. You played a significant role in shaping the person I am
        today.I wanted to reach out and let you know that I still value our connection. If
        you ever need someone to talk to or lend a listening ear, know that I'm here for you.I hope we
        can continue this bond with respect and understanding... and uh may this eid bring you joy and love
        ,, and in this opportunity I want to ask you for a favor which Can we at least had a pictuer during this
        Eid....if it's possible... can we take it during Eid and Eid Celebration at KMPP soon???? PLEASE,
        PRETTY!! ðŸ¥º ðŸ¥º ðŸ¥º So just to end this text I just want to say that Our relationship may
        have ended, but the love I once felt for you will always hold a special place in my heart... I'm no
        longer hopeful for you to return... and if you ask me if I still love you or not, well I guess you already know
        the answer... and I'm sorry I still can't ,and I don't want to forget youuu.
